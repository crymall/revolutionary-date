# Revolutionary Date

This is a simple React app that allows a user to pick a Gregorian date and know the equivalent date in the [French Republican Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar).

All thanks to GH user mcorrell, who created the npm package [repubdate](https://github.com/mcorrell/repubdate), a modified version of which this uses. More can be found in the README in src/repubdate.

If you have suggestions or ideas for changes, off with your head! Just kidding. Go ahead and fork and PR.
